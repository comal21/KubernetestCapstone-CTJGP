Terraform Task :

Problem Statement: Launch an Ubuntu EC2 instance (t2.micro) to be used as your terraform workstation. 
From that WS, using terraform, launch an EC2 instance (instance type: t2.micro, OS: Red Hat Linux) to be used as an ansible workstation for the ansible task. Ensure that you create a key (using ssh-keygen) and use it while launching the EC2, so that we can SSH into the ansible WS once it is created.

Create one single terraform file containing: key pair, provider, security group [incoming: 20,80 and outgoing:all], instance) 
or you can create 4 separate files as well.

Hints:
In your terraform WorkstationS, install terraform using following commands
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install wget unzip -y
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.0.11/terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip
$ unzip terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip
$ sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
$ sudo pip3 install awscli 
use aws configure and give your credentials

create a directory and inside that directory create your terraform files to create a instance


Also remember to create key pair using

$ ssh-keygen -f mykey
** Make sure to modify your ami depending upon region and instance you need. Also modify the VPC id **
Finally use the following commands to to create your instance

terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan 
terraform apply
