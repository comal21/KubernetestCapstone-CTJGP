Problem Statement: Once you have created new instance using terraform (as part of terraform task), 
ssh into that instance and install ansible in it. 

After that, you have to install httpd webserver in the managed node. You donâ€™t have separate managed nodes.
So use your ansible workstation itself as the managed node by adding the below line in your host inventory
file:
localhost ansible_connection = local

Hints:
Install ansible using the following commands
$ sudo yum check-update
$ sudo yum install python3.8 wget -y
$ sudo pip3 install awscli boto boto3 ansible
$ ansible --version
use aws configure and give your credentials

Create a inventory in the location /etc/ansible/hosts

localhost ansible_connection=local 
create a directory and inside that directory create your ansible playbook to install httpd webserver



use: ansible-playbook <playbook name.yaml> 
Make sure the webserver is running - using curl
